# LeetCode Easy Problems – Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems categorized as Easy. Each solution includes:

Clean, well-commented code (mostly in JavaScript).

Time and space complexity analysis.

Clear explanation of the approach and logic.

Sample test cases to verify the solution.

My goal with this repo is to track my problem-solving journey and share insights that can help others—especially beginners—improve their algorithmic thinking.

# Future Plans:
Add solutions in other languages (e.g., Python, C++).

Include visual explanations for common patterns.

Share interview preparation tips and problem-solving strategies.

⭐️ Feel free to open issues for discussion or suggest improvements via pull requests!
